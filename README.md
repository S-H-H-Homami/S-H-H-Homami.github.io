# Text-Emotion-Detector
Classification model on texts in order to predict the emotion behind them. in this classification model, no neural network is used. With right amount of preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning, old classic classification algorithms such as Logestic Regression will reach good accuracy.
You can use the source code, the model and the a very simple web app. change them the way you like.
The dataset is also here to use. I mixed up 2 different data sets just for the sake of the argument. Use any dataset you like.
